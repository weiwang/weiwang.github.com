I am currently reading the thoroughly researched and surprisingly readable
history of Bell Labs _[The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American
Innovation]
(http://www.amazon.com/The-Idea-Factory-American-Innovation/dp/0143122797)_ by
Jon Gertner. It is difficult to exaggerate Bell Labs' contributions to modern
technology, and in that matter, the modern way of life. The author did a great
job describing the intellectual environment at Bell Labs that spurred so much
first-class scientific and technological work and try to pinpoint the catalyst
of innovations and originality. To name a few: deep pocket of a "legally
monopoly" company; working on the most promising fields of the time, in this case
electronics and telecommunication; an interdisciplinary structure and an open
culture that encourages, or even requires exchanges; get the best experts
around. This book mostly focuses on the management side and talks about how to
build a organization that does great work. This reminds me of something else, [a
talk] (http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.pdf) by Richard
Hamming, who happened to spend most of his career in Bell Labs, on how on a
personal level a researcher can do remarkable work.
  
  I first heard of Hamming in an undergraduate course on coding theory, from the
  so-called Hamming code that is his namesake. Apparently he was a prominent
  applied mathematicians whose works span several areas. But he was also
  intrigued by the question of "why some researchers did significant work, while
  other, admittedly the majority, some of whom equally or even more gifted and
  hard-working than the successful ones, only did mediocre work and were
  forgotten." This feels like the self-help genre for scientists, but Hamming
  indeed put a few gems of wisdom on the table. Below are some of his major
  points.

- Successful researchers have courage to pursue first-class work.

- Successful researchers don't need to super smart; one success often brings her
  confidence and courage.

- The conventionally ideal working conditions, such as IAS, might not be
  conducive for great work.

- Successful researchers have enormous amount of drive and work really
  hard. That requires immersion in your work and neglects of other aspects of
  life.

- Work hard, but work smart. Ask yourself what are the most important and
  within-your-reach problems of your field.

- Think about the direction in which your field is going and go there.

- Keep your door and your mind open.

- You should do your job in such a fashion that others can build on top of it.

- Learn to present yourself, spend as much time on writing and presenting as
  actually doing research.

- Don't make talks too technical and specific. Cater to as large an audience as
  possible.

- Be economic with your attention and energy. Don't waste them on unnecessary
  ends.

- Always be positive, look for silver linings and turn your weakness into your
  assets.

- You can't have it all. A great career and a nice and casual life are often not
  compatible.

   Hamming was being very honest in his talk (he used several of his colleagues,
   sometimes with real names, to back up his observations), and you can clearly
   tells that he was a driven fellow how clearly enjoyed what he was doing. He
   commented that his generation, who went through World War II, had enormous
   courage, supreme confidence and grand vision that the new generation (we are
   talking about young researchers in the 80's) tend to be lacking. Sadly, it is
   probably even more so for our generations.
