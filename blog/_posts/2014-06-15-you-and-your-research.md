title: How to Do First-class Research (or Work in General)

I am currently reading the thoroughly researched and surprisingly readable
history of Bell Labs _[The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American
Innovation]
(http://www.amazon.com/The-Idea-Factory-American-Innovation/dp/0143122797)_ by
Jon Gertner. It is hard to overstate Bell Labs' contributions to modern
technology, and in that matter, the modern way of life. The author did a great
job describing the intellectual environment at Bell Labs that spurred so many
first-class scientific and technological works and try to pinpoint the catalyst
of innovations and originality. To name a few: 

- deep pocket of a "legally monopoly" company; 
- working on the most promising fields of the time, in this case electronics and telecommunications; 
- an interdisciplinary structure and an open culture that encourages, or even requires exchanges of ideas; 
- get the best experts around. 

This book mostly focuses on the management side and talks about how to build an
organization that does great work. This reminds me of something, [a talk]
(http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.pdf) by Richard Hamming,
who happened to spend most of his career at Bell Labs, on how can do remarkable
works on a personal level.
  
  I first heard of Hamming in an undergraduate course on coding theory, from the
  so-called Hamming code that bears his name. Apparently he was a prominent
  applied mathematicians whose works span several areas. But he was also
  intrigued by the question of "why some researchers did significant work, while
  other, admittedly the majority, some of whom equally or even more gifted and
  hard-working than the successful ones, only did mediocre work and were
  forgotten." This feels like the content of a self-help book for scientists,
  but Hamming indeed put a few gems of wisdom on the table. Below are some of
  his major points.

- Successful researchers have courage to pursue first-class work.

- Successful researchers don't need to be super smart; one success often brings
  a researcher confidence and courage.

- The conventionally ideal working conditions, such as IAS, might not be
  conducive for great works.

- Successful researchers have enormous amount of drive and work really
  hard. That requires immersion in your work and neglects of other aspects of
  life.

- Work hard, but work smart. Ask yourself what are the most important and
  within-your-reach problems of your field.

- Think about the direction in which your field is going and go there.

- Keep your door and your mind open.

- You should do your job in such a fashion that others can build on top of it.

- Learn to present yourself, spend as much time on writing and presenting as
  on actually doing research.

- Don't make talks too technical and specific. Cater to as large an audience as
  possible.

- Be economic with your attention and energy. Don't waste them on unnecessary
  ends.

- Always be positive, look for silver linings and turn your weakness into your
  assets.

- You can't have it all. A great career and a nice and casual life are often not
  compatible.

   Hamming was being very honest in his talk (he used several of his colleagues,
   sometimes with real names, to back up his observations), and you can clearly
   tell that he was a driven fellow how clearly enjoyed what he was doing. He
   commented that his generation, who went through World War II, had enormous
   courage, supreme confidence and grand vision that the new generation (we are
   talking about young researchers in the 80's) tend to be lacking. Sadly, it is
   probably even more so for the current generations.
