The emacs mode that I use the most frequently is ESS. To keep myself on the
bleeding edge of it, I monitor it from the github repository. However, I pull
from the the source very rarely, so that whenever I pull after several months, I
need to re-teach myself some of the fundamentals of ESS. This is not particularly
efficient. So I use this post as a reminder.

**Installation**

This part used to confuse me. I went through the unnecessary unix compiling squence of 

    make
    make install

to install a new version of ESS. But it turns out that installing ESS is as
simple as making sure Emacs knows where to look for the newest Elisp script
files. On a Mac, the default path is <code>/Application/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp/</code>. On a Linux, the default path is <code>/usr/share/emacs23/site-lisp/</code>. After updating the repository, we can check the version of ESS by <code>C-h k ess-version</code>.
