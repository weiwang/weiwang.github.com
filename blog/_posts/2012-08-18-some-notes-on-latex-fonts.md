Some notes on LaTeX fonts

- To change the font size of a block in text mode, the family of commands \tiny \scriptsize \footnotesize \small \normalsize \large \huge can be used. Remember to enclose the entire block together with the command

    {% hightlight latex %}
    {\scriptsize I am an idiot.}
    {% endhighlight %}
