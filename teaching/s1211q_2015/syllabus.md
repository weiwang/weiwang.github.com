-   **Lecture Time and Location**

    Monday - Thursday 2:45p - 4:20p @ 516 Hamilton Hall

-   **Course Description**

    We will cover topics including discrete combinatorial probability;
    common discrete and continuous random variables and their
    distributional theory; population mean, variance, covariance and
    their sample analogs; point estimation; confidence interval;
    hypothesis testing; linear regression; Bayesian methods.

    But since our section meets 95 minutes per day 4 days per week for
    only 6 weeks, the pace will be more intense than if the course is
    spread out over an entire semester. We will selectively cover the
    topics listed above.

-   **Prerequisites**

    One semester of uni-variate Calculus. You should be familiar with derivatives
    and integrals of basic functions, chain rules for differentiating
    composite functions and integration by substitution and integration
    by parts techniques. We will also do some statistical computation
    with `R` statistical computing environment. So some prior exposure
    to programming is expected.

-   **Method of Evaluation**

    There will be 6 homework assignments, due on Thursdays. There will be
    quizzes on Thursdays of week 1, 2, 4 and 5. One midterm is on the Thursday
    of week 3, and the final is on the last day of the course. The contributions
    of different parts are: homework (30%) + quiz (20%) + midterm (20%) + final
    (30%).
