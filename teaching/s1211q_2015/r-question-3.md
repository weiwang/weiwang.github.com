# Hypergeometric Distribution #

Simulate 10,000 hypergeometric random numbers with m=34, n=16, and k=10. Use
`?rhyper` to see the meaning of these parameters.

```r
?rhyper
rhyper(nn=10000, m=34, n=16, k=10)
```

Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation of these 10,000 data points and
compare them with the theoretical mean and standard deviation.
