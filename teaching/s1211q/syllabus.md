    We will cover topics including discrete combinatorial probability;

    distributional theory; population mean, variance, covariance and
    their sample analogs; point estimation; confidence interval;
    hypothesis testing; linear regression; Bayesian methods.

-   **Prerequisites**

    One semester of Calculus. So you should be familiar with derivatives
    and integrals of basic functions, chain rules for differentiating
    composite functions and integration by substitution and integration
    by parts techniques. We will also do some statistical computation
    with `R` statistical computing environment. So some prior exposure
    to programming is expected.
