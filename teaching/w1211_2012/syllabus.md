-   **Lecture Time**

    8:40-9:55am MW, 207 Math

-   **Course Description**

    We will cover topics including discrete combinatorial probability; discrete and continuous distributions; common discrete and continuous random variables; population mean, variance, covariance and
    their sample analogs; point estimation; confidence interval;
    hypothesis testing; linear regression.


-   **Prerequisites**

    One semester of uni-variate Calculus. You should be familiar with derivatives
    and integrals of basic functions, chain rules for differentiating
    composite functions and integration-by-substitution and integration-by-parts techniques. We will also do some statistical computation
    with `R` statistical computing environment. So some prior exposure
    to programming is expected.

-   **Method of Evaluation**

    There will be weekly homework assignments (due on Wednesdays, one lowest score will be dropped), 2 quizzes (25 min each; tentative dates: Sep 26th and Nov 14th), 1 midterm (75 min; tentative date: Oct 24th), and 1 final exam (2 hours). Their contributions to your grade will be respectively 30%, 10%, 25% and 35%. 

-   ** Late Submission Policy** 

    For problem sets that are due on Wednesdays, you will receive 80% credit (your actual grade times 80%) if handing in before the weekend, 50% credit if handing in next week but no later than next Wednesday's lecture, 0 credit after next Wednesday's lecture.

    The homework drop box is located at Rm 904 School of Social Work (the first room at the left down the hallway).
