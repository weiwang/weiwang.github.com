R Resources

- The definite guide is of course the official [manuals](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/). For beginners, read the [R Introduction](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf).
- But the official manuals tend to be very dry. I found [this page](http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~larget/r.html) by Prof. Bret Larget at Univ. of Wisconsin quite accessible for newbies.
- Contributed Documentation on CRAN [http://cran.us.r-project.org/other-docs.html](http://cran.us.r-project.org/other-docs.html).
- Subscribe to R-help mailing list. [https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help)
- Stackoverflow [R tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
- [R-bloggers.com](R-bloggers.com) aggregates blog entries that are written about R. A daily must-read for me.
- I don't think you actually need to buy a book to learn R. As it is the case for the software itself, there are so many free and wonderful manuals and documentations contributed by the community. However, if you are an intermediate user and want to understand some of the inner mechanism (or philosophy) of R, John Chambers' _Software for Data Analysis: Programming with R_ is a wonderful book.
