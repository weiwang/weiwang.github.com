Every major frequentist statisitcal model has its Bayesian version(s). For fully
parametric models, the most naive Bayesianization is just to impose priors on
parameters. For semi-parametric models, things become a little bit interesting,
since we now have a whole arsenal of Bayesian semi-parametric tricks at our
disposal. Bayesian version of Cox Regerssion is a very good example.
