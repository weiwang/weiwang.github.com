<p>I am a PhD student at <a href="http://stat.columbia.edu">Department of
Statistics</a>, Columbia University. I work on various interesting problems in
applied statistics, including survey sampling, causal inference and missing data
imputation, mostly with a Bayesian and computational flavor. When I am not by my
computer waiting for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sample to converge, I spend
time training for triathlon, dancing Argentine tango and playing Irish folk tunes
on guitar. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in 2009 from <a
href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of
China</a>. </p>
