<p>I am a fifth year PhD student at <a href="http://stat.columbia.edu">Department
of Statistics</a>, Columbia University. I work on various interesting problems in
applied statistics, including survey sampling, causal inference and missing data
imputation, often with a computational flavor. When I am not by my computer
waiting for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sample to converge, I spend time
training for triathlon, dancing Argentine tango and playing Irish folk tunes on
guitar. I received my Bachelor of Science degree in 2009 from <a
href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of
China</a>. </p>
