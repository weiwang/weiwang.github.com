<p>I am a PhD student at <a href="http://stat.columbia.edu">Department of
Statistics</a>, Columbia University. I am interested in computational statistics
with applications in social science and public health. When I am not waiting by
my computer for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo to converge, you can find me
running/swimming/cycling, dancing tango and playing Irish folk tunes on guitar. I
received my Bachler of Science degree in 2009 from <a
href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of Science and Technology of
China</a>. </p>
