<p>I am a PhD candidate at <a href="http://stat.columbia.edu">Department of
Statistics</a>, Columbia University. My interests lie in answering social,
political and public health questions using data and statistical and
computational techniques. I have written papers on predicting elections on Xbox,
analyzing social surveys with nested structures and a valid statistical
foundation for combining results from multiple studies. I received my Bachelor of
Science degree in 2009 from <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">University of
Science and Technology of China</a>. </p>
